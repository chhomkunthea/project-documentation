If you need to collaborate at real time to encode a file with others people, it can be useful to use the teletype tool of the Atom editor.
Before following this procedure, see the previous guide to [install Atom](https://github.com/erc-dharma/project-documentation/blob/master/guides/atom/UsingAtom_v01.md).

## Install Teletype for Atom
 go to the `settings` or `Atom > preferences...` depending your computer, in your toolbar. In the opening settings, go to the tab  `+install` at the bottom of the left panel.
 Search for `teletype` and click on the `install` button.

## Share a portal
Click on the antenna icon in the Atom status bar at the bottom right of the Editor.

Flip the switch to start sharing a portal to your workspace.

Then invite people to join your portal by sending them your portal URL.

## Join a portal
Once someone has provided you with a link to their portal, simply follow the link to join the portal. The portal opens and all collaborators can edit together in real time.
