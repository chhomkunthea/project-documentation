## Starting
Git and Github are integrated in Atom as part of the core package.
You can open the panel from the tool bar: `Packages -> GitHub -> Toggle Git Tab` and `Toggle GitHub Tab`.
Or you can also both panels from the status bar at the bottom right of the editor by clicking on the icons.

## Clone a repository
To clone a repository, open the GitHub panel while you have no project folders open in Atom and click "Clone an existing GitHub repository". In the dialog, paste the URL of a repository and click "Clone". The new project will be added to the Tree View.
