Finish reconciliation between slamfest fork of stylesheets and newest version of stylesheets. The following tasks still need to be addressed:

* htm-teilistbiblandbibl.xsl  -- slamfest version (epidoc-p5-xslt) had some logic for handling ptr lookups; this now needs to be reconciled against what I reimplemented meantime in the other files for ptr and so forth
* htm-teilb.xsl   -- default epidoc code has changed significantly; need to figure out what the specific change for slamfest was and reimplement
* htm-tpl-apparatus.xsl   --- not clear what diff is/was (see above, sub "htm-teidiv.xsl")
*  txt-tpl-apparatus.xsl   --- not clear what diff is/was (see above, sub "htm-teidiv.xsl")
* tpl-reasonlost.xsl is commented out and marked deprecated in the new start-edition.xsl; will have to re-implement the function that we folded in there :(
